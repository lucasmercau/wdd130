    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Our target audience is people looking to live new experiences that take them out of their day to day. They are people who enjoy being outdoors and admire nature. This group of people includes families, young adults, and groups of friends. This website's content, colors, fonts, and general design would be oriented to this group of people, using colors that evoke a feeling of adventure and exploration and with quality images that show our services. This group of people wants to connect more with nature and live new experiences. My audience will connect to this site through laptops or desktops as they would like a quiet place to read all the information they need to purchase any of our services.
