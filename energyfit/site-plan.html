      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I want to create a Fitness Coaching Platform, 
        the purpose of it is to have a page that offers 
        fitness coaching services. The website will serve as a 
        hook for individuals seeking personalized fitness guidance, 
        workout programs, and nutrition advice. Our fitness coaching 
        platform aims to empower individuals by providing tailored 
        workout programs and personalized support, ensuring that people 
        of all fitness levels and backgrounds can achieve 
        their health and wellness goals.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <p>The intended audience for my fitness coaching platform 
        includes individuals of various fitness levels and 
        backgrounds who are motivated to improve their physical 
        well-being. It targets fitness enthusiasts, and individuals 
        looking for expert guidance and accountability in their fitness
